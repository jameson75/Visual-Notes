With minimal effort you a can easily create Org Charts, Flow Charts, Network Diagrams 
and... oh yeah, UML Diagrams. Simply select the symbol you want to create
and tap (well, maybe a drag too). We've maximized our efforts to minimize yours. Check out
our feature list.<br><br>

<b>Summary</b><br>
<br>
<b>Predefined Symbols</b><br>
Visual Notes comes with predefined Flow Chart, Org Chart and UML Symbols. Each symbol has
customizable properties so you can create diagrams with your own look and feel.<br>
<br>
<b>Prepackaged Bitmaps</b><br>
Visual Notes comes with prepackaged bitmaps of network symbols. No drawing is required
to create visual appealing network models.<br>
<br>
<b>Snapped Edges</b><br>
<b>Question:</b> Do I have to draw an edge over when I move a symbol across the canvas?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Ofcourse not. In Visual Notes 1.0, edges simply snap to the sides of your 
symbol Inotherwords, to minimize <i>your</i> efforts, edges move when your symbols move.<br>
<br>
<b>Embedded Diagrams</b><br>
Complex diagrams require complex features. With Visual Notes 1.0, you can embed diagrams into
symbols and navigate between them as you please.<br>
<br>
<b>Spatial Hierarchies</b><br>
Use spatial hierarchies to group symbols and control the Z-Order (layering). For example, I usually
make my labels children of a symbol they identify so that they always appear infront of the symbol 
and automatically moves whenever the symbol moves.<br>
<br>
<b>Undo/Redo Support</b><br>
If this is not your first Pocket PC shareware download, you may have noticed the lack of support for
both undoing and redoing your actions. That's one feature you won't miss in this application.<br>
<br>
<b>Resizable Canvas</b><br>
Ofcourse we had to include this feature. How could we possibly predict the limitation of your
ideas. So make room for your imagination with a resizable canvas area.<br>
<br>
<b>Detailed User Help</b><br>
Although Visual Notes 1.0 is quite intuitive, anyone could use a little help. So we provided
ALOT. Visual Notes help files are integrated with the Pocket PC help system to make your life
just that much easier.<br>
<br>
<b>And More</b><br>
We've only listed a few of the many features you'll find in Visual Notes 1.0. So what are you waiting
for? Hurry up and purchase Visual Notes before developers of other modeling packages realize what 
features we've included and how low we're selling it for and... wait a minute.
